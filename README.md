## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
This application requires the following Python packages:
- streamlit
- pandas
- numpy
- yfinance
- plotly

### Running the Application

1. **Local Development**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py --server.port 3000 --server.address 0.0.0.0
   ```

2. **Replit Environment**:
   The application is configured to run automatically in Replit using the `.replit` configuration file.

### Using the Application

1. **Set Parameters**: Use the sidebar to configure:
   - Start and end dates for the backtest period
   - Sampling frequency (Daily, Weekly, Monthly)
   - Rebalancing frequency (None, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly)
   - Transaction costs in basis points
   - Annual risk-free rate for Sharpe ratio calculation
   - Benchmark for comparison (None, SPY, QQQ)

2. **Build Your Portfolio**: 
   - Use the interactive table to add ticker symbols and weights
   - Weights are automatically normalized to sum to 100%
   - Empty tickers and duplicates are automatically filtered out
   - Supports any Yahoo Finance symbol (stocks, ETFs, indices)

3. **Run Backtest**: Click the "Run Backtest" button to:
   - Fetch historical price data
   - Simulate portfolio performance with rebalancing
   - Calculate comprehensive performance metrics
   - Generate interactive charts
   - Provide downloadable results

## How It Works

### Weight Normalization
Portfolio weights are automatically normalized to ensure they sum to 100%. For example:
- Input: AAPL: 40%, MSFT: 30%, GOOGL: 20%
- Normalized: AAPL: 44.4%, MSFT: 33.3%, GOOGL: 22.2%

### Rebalancing Strategies
- **None**: Buy and hold strategy with no rebalancing
- **Monthly**: Rebalance on the last trading day of each month
- **Quarterly**: Rebalance on the last trading day of each quarter
- **Yearly**: Rebalance on the last trading day of each year

### Transaction Costs
Transaction costs are calculated based on portfolio turnover:
- Turnover = Sum of absolute differences between current and target weights
- Cost = Turnover Ã— (Basis Points / 10,000)
- Applied only on rebalancing dates

### Performance Metrics
- **Total Return**: Cumulative return over the entire period
- **CAGR**: Compound Annual Growth Rate
- **Volatility**: Annualized standard deviation of returns
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return using the specified risk-free rate
- **Max Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline

## Supported Assets

The application works with any symbol available on Yahoo Finance, including:
- **US Stocks**: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA, etc.
- **ETFs**: SPY, QQQ, VTI, BND, etc.
- **International Markets**: ASML (NASDAQ), 7203.T (Tokyo), etc.
- **Cryptocurrencies**: BTC-USD, ETH-USD, etc.
- **Commodities**: GC=F (Gold), CL=F (Oil), etc.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements and feature additions:

### Advanced Rebalancing
- **Drift-band Rebalancing**: Rebalance only when weights drift beyond specified thresholds
- **Volatility-based Rebalancing**: Adjust rebalancing frequency based on market volatility
- **Tax-aware Rebalancing**: Optimize for tax efficiency in taxable accounts

### Analytics Enhancements
